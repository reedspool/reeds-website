          Future me made some more examples. One was tilting each line in a
          whacky way. That made more sense than the watery version and was
          simpler to implement. The other one was complicated; a snake being
          weaving in and out and around a bunch of text. I knew how to implement
          that in theory, but in practice I thought I would have to learn quite
          a bit

        What would you do if you could target line breaks in web pages? The goal
        of this article is to explain what that question means, explore some fun
        answers, and hopefully start a broader discussion on the topic.
      </p>

      <p>
        I started this article as an exploration of
        <button
          data-js="press this to insert an explanation of what that one answer is"
        >
          one answer to that question,
        </button>
        but I soon realized that the question was bigger and more interesting
        than my one narrow answer. I want to discuss the broader topic, and so I
        want to explain the basics to engage as many people as possible with the
        topic.

      <aside class="hidden">
        This paragraph is in an <code>aside</code> element that is interjected
        into the surrounding paragraph without affecting the way lines are
        broken up. Achieving this inerjection was the first thing I tried to
        achieve which led me to this whole exploration.

        Browsers have handled line breaks since their inception. And they do it
        so well that web developers barely ever think about it. One time it
        comes up is when a graphic designer designs for the web, they might
        expect to have control over typesetting paragraphs of text. I've had
        several conversations with graphic designers where I've had to explain
        that I had no idea how to ensure there would never be widows (?) on
        their webpage.
      </p>

        Boxes appear on web pages all the time, in all different places and
        contexts. In this article, I present a novel way to position boxes which
        dynamically interject between two visual lines of inline text with no
        disruption to the flow of that text. I call these boxes "insets," which
        I hope alludes to a familiar graphic design concept.

        I have a lot to say about the what, why, and how. But before that, I
        figure I should give you an example of the result I'm looking for. So
        you can
        <button data-js="press one of these to move the first quote to here">
          press this button
        </button>
        to make a little quote appear. The point of this project is for that
        quote not to interrupt the flow of the paragraph surrounding it. So, in
        a very boring way, nothing should change except for a quote appearing
        when you click that button. Oh, and you can
        <button data-js="press one of these to move the first quote to here">
          press this button
        </button>
        to remove the quote from up there and move it back to here. That way you
        can get some picture that this is dynamic. Especially fun to try would
        be resizing this paragraph with the little handlebar on the lower right
        hand side, and then clicking both buttons to see how the flow of the
        paragraph does or does not change around it.

        also appreciate help to find a simpler or more effective method to
        achieve the goal, since my method feels both complex and fragile.
      </p>

      <p>
        I hope this article intrigues several audiences such as web developers,
        browser developers, graphic designers, interface designers, and product
        designers. For a different topic, I might chop up several more focused
        chunks for each intended audience instead of one big'n. But here, the
        conceptual purpose is to enable different folks to dig into different
        aspects of a complicated subject, so I kept it all together. Please
        disregard any JavaScript, jargon, or jokes you don't jive with.

        There's a surprising amount of complexity to unpack to present a full
        picture of my goal. So in this section I'm going to work step-by-step
        from the fundamentals of web development up to the whole shebang.
      </p>

      <p>Take for example a <code>blockquote</code> element like this one:</p>

      <blockquote>
        Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas any more. - Dorothy Gale, The
        Wizard of Oz
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The quote above is an example of an "inset." I got this word "inset"
        from a graphic designer friend. What they told me, in my own words, is
        that an inset is a design element which is distinct from the surrounding
        area but whose content is contextually relevant. If you know a better
        word, please let me know. Here's another
        <code>aside</code> element used as an inset with some more commentary
        from me:
      </p>

      <aside>
        My own use of the word "inset" here confuses me in the context of web
        development, because
        <code>inset</code> has several distinct meaning in CSS
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inset"
          target="_blank"
          title="MDN reference for the CSS property called 'inset'"
          >as a shorthand for positioning</a
        >,
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow#inset"
          target="_blank"
          title="MDN reference for the CSS box-shadow inset value"
          >as a positional switch for box shadows</a
        >,

          title="MDN reference for CSS border line-style inset value"
          >as a border style</a
        >, and probably other places I'm unaware of.
      </aside>

      <p>
        So you have two examples of insets already, the
        <code>blockquote</code> and the <code>aside</code> above. They're
        sitting there, inert in the flow of the document. They don't interject,
        they wait their turn.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now imagine that one of those could just appear out of nowhere. In fact,
        you don't have to imagine it, you can
        <button
          data-js="press this for an inset between two paragraphs to appear"
        >
          press this button
        </button>
        to see one pop up below this paragraph. I'll also include a number (e.g.
        <code>#1</code>), so when you click the button multiple times, you can
        distinguish the order in which each appeared.
      </p>

      <script type="text/javascript">
        {
          const thisScript = document.currentScript;
          let count = 0;
          document
            .querySelector(
              '[data-js="press this for an inset between two paragraphs to appear"]',
            )
            .addEventListener("click", () => {
              const blockquote = document.createElement("blockquote");
              blockquote.innerText =
                `We are as much informed of a writer\'s genius` +
                ` by what he selects as by what he originates.` +
                ` - Ralph Waldo Emerson, "Quotation and Originality,"` +
                ` Letters and Social Aims, 1876 (#${++count})`;
              thisScript.parentElement.insertBefore(
                blockquote,
                thisScript.nextElementSibling,
              );
            });
        }
      </script>

      <p>
        Note the position of the previous button is inline within a paragraph.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, note the distance between the button in the prior paragraph and the
        effect of that button. Sure, it's only a couple lines of text away. If
        you're on a big screen, you may not even know what I mean by "distance."
        It might feel like that new inset appears immediately after the button.
        But if you're on a small screen, that button might be near the bottom of
        your screen, in which case the effect of the button is completely
        invisible! And that distance only gets larger as the width of the
        paragraph shrinks, and the text extends downwards, even further from the
        button.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, that's the issue. Now, the first solution I imagined was: what if we
        could do the same thing, have an inset magically appear, but it appears
        immediately below the button. At first glance, this feels like a simple
        and sufficient solution. Let's try it and observe what happens.
        <button
          data-js="press this to add a blockquote immediately after this button that breaks the paragraph up"
        >
          Press this button
        </button>
        to insert another quote. This one is a bit different in that more text
        will be added over a period of 10 seconds. Hopefully you'll see the
        problem I feel with this.
      </p>
      <script type="text/javascript">
        {
          let count = 0;
          const button = document.querySelector(
            '[data-js="press this to add a blockquote immediately after this button that breaks the paragraph up"]',
          );
          button.addEventListener("click", () => {
            const blockquote = document.createElement("blockquote");
            const text = [
              "You're already in that cage. ",
              "You built it yourself. ... ",
              "No matter where you run,",
              "you just end up running into yourself. ",
              `- Truman Capote, Breakfast at Tiffany's (#${++count})`,
            ];

            button.parentElement.insertBefore(blockquote, button.nextSibling);
            const addText = () => {
              blockquote.innerHTML += text.shift() + "&nbsp;";
              if (text.length !== 0) setTimeout(addText, 2500);
            };
            addText();
          });
        }
      </script>
      <p>
        Because the <code>blockquote</code> element is a
        <code>block</code> element, it immediately separates the
        <code>inline</code> <code>button</code> immediately before it, and the
        <code>inline</code> text node after it. The outcome is it that it looks
        like 3 <code>block</code> elements stacked ontop of each other. This
        disrupts the flow of the sentence. Depending on your screen width and
        the font-size, it may also create a scenario where the button is sitting
        on a row all by itself. In short, it works, but it feels awkward. And it
        feels awkward enough taht I wouldn't want to use it.
      </p>

      <p>
        To get the best of both of these scenarios, we'd like text to flow
        exactly as it did before the new inset appeared, up to the point where a
        new block element appears, and then for the text to continue below it
        exactly as if it was always supposed to be this way.
      </p>

      <p>
        To show what I'm looking for, I have this static example below. It's a
        <code>blockquote</code> with an <code>aside</code> interjected. Sorry,
        no buttons this time. But we'll be back to that soon.
      </p>
      <!-- prettier-ignore -->
      <blockquote style="white-space: pre;">One fish
two fish<aside style="white-space: initial;">The poem never refers to "fishes," which suggests they're all the same species, despite "not one of them [being] like another."</aside>red fish
blue fish
- Dr. Seuss, "One fish two fish red fish blue fish"</blockquote>

      <p>
        Imagine the button which created this dynamic effect was on the word
        <q>two</q> in the poem above. That would result in <q>fish</q> being
        split off from it inappropriately. So how would we make this happen?
      </p>

      <p>
        It's obnoxiously hard to achieve because the algorithm for flowing text
        on a webpage doesn't easily allow for it. The vagueness of this
        statement might suggest that this is the limit of my understanding of
        that algorithm, so maybe there is a simpler solution deep in the heart
        of the HTML spec. Otherwise, my understanding is that mostly HTML
        expects this sort of concept to be achieved via manually or
        programattically splitting text notes into different elements or
        separate text nodes.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, that's exactly the plan. The trick will be to determine where to
        split the text nodes up. To do that, we'll have to figure out where the
        line break currently is before making the split. And that's most of the
        business of achieving this. My thought on how to achieve this is to use
        the JavaScript
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Range"
          target="_blank"
          ><code>Range</code> API</a
        >. A close cousin of <code>Range</code> is <code>Selection</code>. If
        you've ever selected text on a webpage by clicking and dragging with
        your mouse on text or long-pressing and dragging with your finger,
        you've created a <code>Selection</code> in the native way. And if you
        have, then you have some intimate, first-hand feel for how
        <code>Range</code> works as well. With a <code>Range</code>, we can make
        the JavaScript parallel of a native selection. We can also literally
        select text and other HTML elements this way.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, my idea is to create a <code>Range</code> object around the pressed
        button, and then move it and shift it and calculate it to discover
        exactly where the text breaks into a new line. And when I find the place
        where the text breaks, I will split it there into two separate elements.
        Finally, once the text is split, I can insert the new inset between the
        two elements as I've done already.
      </p>

      <p>
        To begin, you can
        <button data-js="press this to select some text">
          press this button
        </button>
        to
        <span data-js="target for button to select some text"
          >select this text (from the previous word "select" to the period after
          this parenthetical)</span
        >. When you press the button, you should see your native selection
        appear.
      </p>

      <script type="text/javascript">
        document
          .querySelector("[data-js='press this to select some text']")
          .addEventListener("click", () => {
            const selection = document.getSelection();
            const nodeToSelect = document.querySelector(
              "[data-js='target for button to select some text']",
            );
            const range = document.createRange();

            range.selectNodeContents(nodeToSelect);
            selection.selectAllChildren(nodeToSelect);
            // To confirm my understanding of the parity between these two APIs
            console.log(
              "Range:",
              range,
              "Selection:",
              selection,
              "Other:",
              range.startContainer === range.endContainer &&
                selection.anchorNode === selection.focusNode &&
                selection.anchorNode === range.startContainer
                ? "Range and selection target exactly the same thing:"
                : "Something's off",
              range.startContainer,
            );
          });
      </script>

      <p>
        A <code>Range</code> works exactly the same way, but it's invisible. In
        fact, the prior button also created a separate, new range which included
        the same text. Well, technically, a selection can contain multiple
        ranges, but we can ignore that complication for now. (Note to self, come
        back to research this complication later. How does a selection with
        multiple ranges get formed natively? If it can only be formed through
        JavaScript, maybe this is not very interesting)
      </p>

      <p>
        From here, the next experiment I wanted to do was to exactly select one
        line of text. My idea was to add the button itself to the range, then
        calculate the range's height using the
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Range/getBoundingClientRect"
          target="_blank"
          ><code>Range: getBoundingClientRect()</code> method</a
        >. Once I had that base height, I could extend the range in either
        direction until the height changed, and then back track to find the
        maximum extent of the range that maintains that base height. So you can
        <button data-js="press this to select the surrounding line of text">
          press this button</button
        >, and it should select exactly the visual line as you see it. This is
        an interesting result because this is all one text node within a single
        <code>p</code> (paragraph) element. Compare with the previous
        experiment, where I made a <code>span</code> element to target
        specifically. Again, the goal is to create an invisible range. The
        selection is just copying that result to visually show the
        accomplishment. There's an additional complication here that if you
        resize the browser with this selection, the visual line layout might
        change. In that case, the selection should reset.
      </p>

        I was surprised to find that the base height (that is, the
        <code>height</code> property of the range's
        <code>boundingClientRect</code> after the button was selected) was
        exactly <code>21</code>. At that time, I had no CSS on the page, so only
        the default user agent stylesheet (for Chrome) was active. The font size
        was 16, and the <code>line-height</code> was set to <code>normal</code>.
        I didn't know what <code>normal</code> meant, and I was surprised to
        find that it wasn't easy to find. In fact, one of the only

          >cohesive answers to that question on StackOverflow</a
        >
        was to do exactly what I was doing. So I concluded that the answer was
        that the current line height value was <code>21/16=~1.3</code>.

        I came back to this a few days later. In that time, I tried to search
        again for other people's solutions to this challenge. I wasn't sure what
        to search, so I tried a few things. The only phrase that got me where I
        wanted was "detect rendered line breaks". That got me two relevant
        results, a

          target="_blank"
          >blog post</a
        >. The solutions were similar to each other, and similar to my approach
        as well. They also shared a limitation that they relied on the
        assumption that the element in question was only filled with text nodes.
        This highlighted a difference from my approach. I wanted to achieve a
        similar, but more complex goal, by supporting more complex DOM trees.
        But, it also highlighted a path for me. I could start by achieving their
        simpler task of traversing a single linear text node before traversing a
        more complex DOM.

        I recognized this challenge in my concept for a solution. I was
        depending on the height of a range changing. But how much change? For
        example, in a simple case I was imagining a strict doubling of the
        height to signal a new line. But if I extended the range into a span
        with a different font size, for example, then the height might change by
        a small amount. I wasn't sure how to account for this.
      </aside>
      <p>
        Once I could show a range surrounding a rendered line, I felt my
        solution was theoretically sound. I wasn't convinced that it was
        practically sound because I hadn't tested every edge case exhaustively.
        I could imagine a lot of edge cases, like:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Arbitrarily nested DOM elements near the rendered line break</li>
        <li>Different font sizes within a rendered line</li>
        <li>
          Different box model adjustments like vertical padding within a
          rendered line
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        With that many edge cases which I could imagine, I guessed there were
        many more edge cases I failed to imagine waiting just around the corner.
        With known unknowns and unknown unknowns lurking, I could spend a lot of
        time trying to achieve that basic selection example for as many
        real-world cases as possible. Instead of spending that time, with a
        theoretical win under my belt, I decided to press forward to see my
        immediate goal functional. So, if you
        <button
          data-js="press this to make an inset appear beneath this visual line"
        >
          press this button
        </button>
        a new inset should appear beneath the current visual line. And that
        visual line should not change at all. The Range API only has an
        <code>insertNode</code> at the start, not at the end. Luckily this
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/65357587" target="_blank"
          >StackOverflow answer</a
        >
        presents an elegant solution to collapse the Range to its end, to make
        its start and end the same. Oh, and you should be able to
        <button
          data-js="press this to make an inset appear above this visual line"
        >
          press this button
        </button>
        to make a new inset appear above this visual line! The solutions for
        above and below should be exactly the same. As I wrote this, I only
        imagined a use-case for creating a new inset beneath the current line,
        but since they were so similar, it wasn't much effort to achieve both at
        the same time.

        One caveat I found was that my functions seemed to work differently if I
        started with <code>range.selectNode(button)</code> versus
        <code>range.selectNodeContents(button)</code>. I thought these two
        should work exactly the same since my DOM traversal algorithm had to
        navigate outside wherever the selection began. So that signaled a bug in
        the traversal code.

        I immediately ran into an edge case. After inserting one block DOM node
        after the current visual line, doing the same thing again erred. When I
        tried to insert a second DOM node in the same position, my algorithm
        actually inserted it inside the first one I inserted! This was because
        my algorithm moved the <code>endContainer</code> of the range beyond the
        line. A quick fix for this was to detect if after applying my algorithm
        if the <code>endContainer</code> was at the beginning of an
        <code>HTMLElement</code> and insert before that instead if so.

        Interestingly, when I changed the body text to
        <code>text-align: justify;</code>, that messed with the strategy. The
        strategy still worked, but the text itself reflowed after the change.
        When I went to figure out why, I found there was a similar value,
        <code> text-align: justify-all;</code> that expressly fixed this issue.
        All the <code>-all</code> suffix does is "also force the last line to be
        justified." But,
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/43427301" target="_blank"
          >as this StackOverflow answer shows</a
        >
        it's completely unsupported. Luckily that same answer points to the
        property <code>test-align-last</code>, which works perfectly on Chrome.
        I'll need to test on other browsers. Unfortunately, it looks really bad
        when the last visual line only has a few words. They get spread out
        along the entire line. I can see why this is an uncommon strategy! So I
        considered changing my strategy to, when interjecting an inset, if the
        wrapper that I'm interjecting within is set to
        <code>text-align: justify</code>, to then also set
        <code>text-align-last: justify</code>, to preserve the spacing of the
        last line.

          I found an issue that might render this whole thing a mess. When I
          wrote a <code>blockquote</code> tag within a <code>p</code> tag my
          HTML formatter,
          <a href="https://prettier.io/" target="_blank">Prettier</a>, gave me a
          warning to let me know that my strategy was a little strange, with a
          pointer to the relevant section in
          <a
            href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#closing-elements-that-have-implied-end-tags"
            target="_blank"
            >the spec</a
          >. The point was that some HTML tags should cause an HTML parser to
          close any surrounding tags, as if there was an end tag literally
          written for them. I'm not sure about this so please correct me if you
          know, but I believe that this is so HTML can be more flexible than
          strict HTML and recover from issues. And that would imply that a
          <code>blockquote</code> tag within a <code>p</code> as I'd written was
          an issue. MDN refers to this as "tag omission" on
          <a

            >this StackOverflow answer</a
          >
          explained that the "paragraph" content fell under a specific
          categorization called "phrasing content,". I learned through this that
          "paragraph" referred to more than just the <code>p</code> element.
          Always interesting to dive into the massive HTML spec!
        </p>

        <p>
          So what did this mean for my strategy? Well, my strategy was different
          than parsing HTML. My strategy involved dynamically injecting HTML
          elements into other HTML elements. None of that involved the HTML
          parser. But I'd never considered the effect of injecting HTML
          dynamically on HTML validation. The reason I found this was because I
          was trying to write out my end goal in my HTML file to help imagine
          how to write JavaScript to meet that goal. My actual end goal wouldn't
          rely on that. So I could move on with that goal without answering
          these questions. But the questions still bugged me. Did this
          invalidate my whole approach here? Should I not ever inject block
          elements into a paragraph, even if I could do it without the HTML
          parser getting in my way?

          events for those though, since I'd never done it before. As a
          professional web developer, I'd added page resize event handlers a
          thousand times, but never a handler for when a smaller object is

            const entry = entries[0];
            if (entry.borderBoxSize.length > 1)

        Had the idea to implemnt this as a plugin to some well known markdown
        static site generator which would perform this "inline" magic for
        reference style markdown links and footnotes. That might be a good way
        to get a handle on its place in the wild. If this could serve a useful
        function for a tool with a large user base, that would help narrow down
        the project's boundaries, which right now feel endless.
