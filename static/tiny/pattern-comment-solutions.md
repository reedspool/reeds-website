# Comment on Solutions

Whenever you search for an answer, record the answer somewhere. When you verbalize, it solidifies the problem and answer in your brain.

If you found an answer or discussion on a web page, put a link to that web page in the comment. Yes, even if it's long and unaesthetic. Don't use a link shortening service which could break over time.

StackOverflow answers have a "Share" button which provides a short link to that exact answer. Perfect to store in a comment.
