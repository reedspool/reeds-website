# Add RSS to my site.

This project was for my old [Static Site Generator](/2023/projects/project-new-static-site-generator.md "project-new-static-site-generator.md")

First I found how to get the RSS feed for one of my favorite YouTube channels which I already happened to follow via an Android RSS aggregator app Feeder:

```sh
curl https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UClZbO3wehSIsPUKLx_X5caw
```

I figured if anyone would have a quality RSS example, it would be YouTube or podcasts.

I then Googled around for "RSS npm package" and found a couple packages and [a tutorial](https://blog.logrocket.com/adding-rss-feed-next-js-app/).

The tutorial pointed me to the [`feed` NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/feed) which I hadn't seen in my initial search.

I installed `feed`. Then I grabbed the example configuration code from their readme and began to fill it in.

```js
import { Feed } from "feed";

const feed = new Feed({
  title: "Reed's Website",
  description: "Updates and additions",
  id: "https://reeds.website/",
  link: "https://reeds.website/",
  language: "en", // optional, used only in RSS 2.0, possible values: http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/struct/dirlang.html#langcodes
  image: "http://reeds.website/assets/circle_r.svg",
  favicon: "http://reeds.website/favicon.ico",
  copyright: "All rights reserved 2023, Reed Spool",
  // updated: new Date(2013, 6, 14), // optional, default = today
  generator: "awesome", // optional, default = 'Feed for Node.js'
  feedLinks: {
    rss2: `https://reeds.website/rss.xml`,
    json: `https://reeds.website/rss.json`,
    atom: `https://reeds.website/atom.xml`,
  },
  author: {
    name: "Reed's Website",
    email: "reedwith2es@gmail.com",
    link: "https://reeds.website/",
  },
});
```

That was easy, so I moved on to considering how I would populate the feed with posts. The example code in `feed`'s README:

```js
posts.forEach({
  url, description, content, date, image
} => {
  feed.addItem({
    title,
    id: url,
    link: url,
    description,
    content,
    author: [],
    contributor: [],
    date,
    image
  });
});
```

So those were the properties I needed to derive for each post:.

```js
{
  (url, description, content, date, image);
}
```

Before moving on, I wanted to verify that the code would work, so I added it to <GitHubLink extraPath="/blob/6bcaf25e60d2170a5bb9e132d2a93c9878163588/src/compile-all-posts-page.jsx" text="my compilation script" />.

I realized I'd need to export each title from each project file because I'd need to put that in each feed. I'd probably want to export a description as well. I wasn't sure what would go in the `content` field.

Before doing that, I decided just to push the working RSS and try to put it in my own RSS feeder to see what the audience experience is like.

I was easily able to add the feed on my reader app!

I made a new page that would be a reverse-chronological change-log from which my RSS feed would be generated. I did this instead of simply adding each new page to my blog because I wanted my site to be filled with long-lived, often-updated project pages. I'd want a place to write about and link to my updates rather than making a brand new page before making a new post to my RSS feed.

I experimented with some bogus entries in my feed and watched how they looked in my app. They generally looked pretty terrible!

I added an RSS feed link to my page generic footer. I used an icon from the [Boxicons project](https://boxicons.com/?query=rss).
