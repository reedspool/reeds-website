Made this page as a quick tool to send people to start the conversation to schedule some time together.

Reduced the wording. Don't want to burden anyone with a wall of text.

Had an issue where I couldn't configure which of my included calendars were read for my availability. The effect was that calendars I had imported for tracking, which did not mean I was busy, were also blocking off possible times in Cal.com.

<future->George told me that Google Calendar had recently released their own tool which was a direct competitor to Cal.com. I tried that out instead. When I checked that out, I found that it wouldn't let me use my imported calendars to avoid conflicts without paying for Google One. Ugh. This tied into [my project to switch my Google accounts](/2024/projects/project-switch-main-google-account.md). I was already paying for Google One on my other account!</future->
