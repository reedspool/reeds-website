# Reed's Website

My home page where I keep my web things. Such as <Link slug="static-animation">my Lovecraftian Love Monster</Link> or <Link slug="static-flags">some responsive flags</Link>.

Many of those web things take the form of <Link slug="project-index">projects</Link> which I often write in <Link slug="about-project-logs">my "project logbook" format</Link>.
