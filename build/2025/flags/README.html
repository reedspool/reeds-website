        <h1>Flags in HTML &amp; CSS</h1>
        <p>
          Inspired by the 2025 Portland Pride Parade and the upcoming
          <a href="https://html.energy/html-day/2025/index.html">HTML Day</a>, I
          recreated popular flags in HTML &amp; CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Details about the design of the flags fascinated me as I researched
          them. Since those details informed how I made my flags, I wanted to
          document them. My research began at the top search results,

            >a great blog post by a company which sells physical flags</a
          >
          as well as the Wikipedia page on &quot;Pride Flags&quot;<a

            title="Wikipedia, Pride flag"

          >.
        </p>
        <h2>Transgender Pride Flag</h2>
        <p>
          The first flag I made. At first, I named my colors &quot;boy&quot;,
          &quot;girl&quot;, and &quot;nonbinary&quot; after
          <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120301065716/http://www.monicahelms.com/blog/category/tg-pride-flag"
            title="Monica Helms's blog, These Colors Don't Run"
            >this quote from the flag's designer, Monica Helms</a
          >:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The stripes at the top and bottom are light blue, the traditional
            color for baby boys. The stripes next to them are pink, the
            traditional color for baby girls. The stripe in the middle is white,
            for those who are intersex, transitioning or consider themselves
            having a neutral or undefined gender.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          I knew I jumped too fast to the term &quot;nonbinary&quot; when I read
          that last, complex description. So I did a tiny bit more research. I
          found
          <a
            href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/research-briefs/diversity-of-nonbinary-youth/"
            title="The Trevor Project, Diversity of Nonbinary Youth"
            >This Report by The Trevor Project, &quot;Diversity of Nonbinary
            Youth&quot;</a
          >, where they found that many people identify as &quot;nonbinary&quot;
          but not &quot;transgender&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
          The complexity of the situation led me back to names descriptive of
          the colors themselves, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;pink&quot;, and
          &quot;white.&quot; While this felt less inspired and dramatic, it also
          felt more inclusive to leave the interpretation up to the reader.
        </p>
        <h2>Non-binary Flag</h2>
        <p>
          I chose the more specific color name &quot;lavender&quot; over the
          more generic &quot;purple&quot; after I learned about that word's
          import to LGBTQ+ history from the flag's Wikipedia page]<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_flag"
            title="Wikipedia, Non-binary flag"
            >wiki-nonbinary-flag</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also I saw two spellings, &quot;non-binary&quot; and
          &quot;nonbinary,&quot; both even on that wikipedia page. I chose the
          one without a <code>-</code> to not confuse the structural dashes in
          my variable names.
        </p>
        <h2>Portland, Oregon City Flag</h2>
        <p>
          When I looked at this flag after I completed my first two flags, its
          geometric complexity intimidated me. So I had to try it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Portland,_Oregon#/media/File:Flag_of_Portland,_Oregon.svg/2"
            title="Wikipedia, Portland Oregon City Flag SVG"
            >Wikipedia had a very nice SVG of it</a
          >, so that was helpful to see exact numbers for the dimensions.
          Unfortunately each element of the flag was cleverly optimized and
          terse to the point of arcana instead of a combination of simple,
          comprehensible elements as I'd like to do it, e.g. here's the 4 green
          rectangles in each corner, represented by a single complicated
          <code>path</code>:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-svg">&lt;path fill=&quot;#046a38&quot; d=&quot;m350 215h250v145h-250zm-350 50h230v95h-230zm300-265h300v95h-300zm-300 0h180v145h-180z&quot;/&gt;
</code></pre>
        <p>
          But I guess that means my work of unpacking those dimensions into a
          version which made more sense to me would be a useful, interesting
          exercise. I tried to unpack the dimensions from the SVG, but I didn't
          have a great understanding of the syntax for the <code>path</code>'s
          <code>d</code> attribute. It would be fun to learn more about that,
          but I decided to focus on making my version instead. So I loaded the
          SVG into Gimp and started measuring the pixels instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found the white gaps were all 10 pixels wide, the yellow stripes
          were 20 pixels wide, and the blue stripes were all 40 pixels wide. I
          had used CSS Grid layouts for my previous flags, and I wondered if
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Subgrid"
            title="MDN, CSS Subgrid"
            >subgrid</a
          >
          could achieve this more complicated design
        </p>

            src="./screenshot-pdx-flag-1.png"
            alt="First screenshot of interesting result using border radius"
            title="Screenshot of PDX flag progress 1"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          <img

            alt="Second screenshot of interesting result using border radius"

          />
        </p>
        <h2>Development Notes</h2>
        <p>
          I used some over-specified names for some things because I imagined it
          would be useful in some possible future where I or someone else copied
          and pasted many of these flags onto one page. This was not at all the
          case to start since I gave myself an entire page for each flag, a
          blank slate to play. When I decided to call colors by their simple
          names, e.g. &quot;blue&quot;, I decided to over-specify the CSS names
          of those variables, so I wouldn't get confused about the &quot;trans
          flag blue&quot;, a light blue, and the &quot;rainbow pride flag
          blue&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
          I had a lot of fun ideas for a control panel on each of the flags with
          buttons to fullscreen, rotate, fit to a standard aspect ratio, change
          background colors and hide the control panel. I decided to forego
          these ideas to focus on making the actual flags first.
