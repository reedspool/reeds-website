        </p>
        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
          The mechanic of a group counting up via cards is directly from
          <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244992/mind"
            >&quot;The Mind&quot; designed by Wolfgang Warsch</a
          >. That game restricts all communication to promote tension and
          uncertainty. The game described here is more ridiculous and unwieldy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea of switching communication methods was inspired by the
          classic parlor game
          <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Fish-Bowl"
            >&quot;Fishbowl&quot;</a
          >, later immortalized into the mechanics of
          <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/156546/monikers"
            >&quot;Monikers&quot; by Alex Hague &amp; Justin Vickers</a
          >.

        <h2>Name ideas</h2>
        <p>I need a name for this game. Just going to brainstorm ideas here:</p>

          By the time I'd started this page, I'd already played the game at 3
          different parties and gotten really positive feedback.

          I recorded all of the communication method details I had on my most
          recent version of the cards into a JavaScript data structure

        <future->
          I had a random side thought about constraints-based programming in web
          development. E.g. the constraint "this content should fit comfortably
          inside its container". How would you test that in JavaScript (outside
          a browser)? I don't know of a way. But within a browser, I know a test
          for that:
          <ol>
            <li>Make the content <code>overflow: auto</code></li>
            <li>If a scrollbar appears, then it doesn't fit.</li>
            <li>If no scrollbar appears, then it fits.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            But the only way to see if that constraint would hold up is to run
            the program in the browser environment, because there's no
            simulation for the complex rules of the browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            And here's where Playwright comes in. Playwright is a headless
            controller for a browser. So if I could ask Playwright to run my
            site, and verify my constraints live, then I'd have a live
            constraint solver.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this project, I could imagine that being very useful for making
            some constraint-based assertions on the shapes of cards.
          </p>
          <h3>Sat Apr 27 12:06:37 PM PDT 2024</h3>
          <p>
            I had an idea of how to solve &quot;the one problem&quot; which
            brought me back to this game. What's &quot;the one problem?&quot;
            The original rules of this game had the numbers always counting up
            from the lowest to the highest. Unfortunately, if you got the number
            1 in your hand, you knew immediately you could play that, because it
            was guaranteed to be the lowest. That meant whoever had the
            <code>1</code> had a better strategy (immediately play the card)
            than the fun strategy (follow the communication method). This game
            was supposed to be fun first, so one person not having fun was an
            immediate failure for me in the role of the game designer. Worse, if
            someone played 1 immediately and someone else had 2, they could play
            their 2 immediately next! And 3, and so on!
          </p>
          <p>
            So, I had an idea for how to fix this, but it complicated the game a
            bit. I felt like I'd have to try iterate more versions of the game
            to work out the kinks of the new, additional complication. And to
            make more incremental progress, I thought I'd have to make more
            cards. I wanted to automate some bit of the process of making the
            cards for a couple reasons. One, I wanted to start to work towards a
            cleaner version of the cards. Second, I wanted to make many versions
            of the deck with slight variations to test out different gameplay
            ideas. And I didn't want to keep using the hand-made version of the
            game anymore anyways because the first version I made on index cards
            was getting a little worse for wear.
          </p>
          <p>
            I began to make a generated printable page on my website so I could
            upgrade from hand-drawn-and-cut cards to stylistic, printed cards.
            My friend said he would help me laminate, and I wanted a visual I
            could be proud of before I did that. Laminating it somehow felt
            significant enought to warrant prior effort, though this was
            probably one of those useless mental blocks.
          </p>
          <p>
            I made
            <a href="/2025/counting-game/index.html">a page for the cards</a>
            and got to work.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had to research how to make a printable page. I had done this
            before to make an easy resume builder, but it had been a while.
          </p>
          <p>
            I learned about a new tool! In Chrome DevTools (not sure about other
            browsers), under the three-dot menu in the top right -&gt; More
            tools -&gt; Rendering -&gt; Emulate CSS type select
            &quot;print&quot; to help simulate
          </p>
          <p>
            I found
            <a href="https://github.com/mcdemarco/cardpen"
              >this interesting project (github)</a
            >
            and <a href="https://cardpen.mcdemarco.net/">online</a> where some
            people worked on a generic, reusable tool for making the kinds of
            cards I wanted to make in HTML.
          </p>
          <h3>Sun Apr 28 07:46:54 PM PDT 2024</h3>
          <p>
            I went to the library for a test print. Some interesting results.
            First, the measurement of poker cards I found online 2.5in width by
            3.5in height was over by 1/32in width and 1/16in height. I was
            surprised to find the border radius I found, 1/8in worked perfectly
            via CSS.
          </p>
          <p>
            I felt silly when I realized I hadn't printed any of the cards with
            English on them.
          </p>
          <h3>Mon Apr 29 01:37:36 PM PDT 2024</h3>
          <p>
            I went back to the library for more printing, this time with my
            laptop. I found energy there to focus on coding. I refactored all my
            cards to use a single component since they'd been converging to a
            similar structure. I also added some runtime checks to assert that
            all my ducks were in a row, for example that I had a symbol for each
            tag I used.
          </p>
          <p>
            I made card backs with the number and communication symbols big on
            the back. It took some programming to make the pages interspersed, 9
            cards then 9 backs on the next page to line up with Chrome's
            printing dialog.
          </p>
          <p>
            I differentiated the card backs based on the type of card. This
            proved to be a bit of a coding challenge because I needed to
            interleave the pages. I.e. Page 1 was 9 card fronts, and Page 2 was
            9 card backs, and they should all line up exactly.
          </p>
          <h3>Mon May 20 12:22:33 PM PDT 2024</h3>
          <p>
            I found an error where two cards had the wrong back. This suggested
            that I had the backs reversed. I should reverse the horizontal
            ordering of the card backs so that they match up when the two pages
            are placed back to back.
          </p>
          <p>
            I learned it was difficult to match up the backs and fronts of
            papers when printing double sided on inkjet printers to within a
            centemeter accuracy. At least that was true of the commercial
            printers I used for free at the local library (thank you library!).
            This resulted in the backs of cards looking unrefined, imprecise. I
            thought of a way to make it a little less of an eye-soar. I changed
            the borders on the backs of the cards to all-white, so that a
            slightly-off border wouldn't show through.
          </p>
          <p>
            I learned from people holding them in their hands that the two kinds
            of cards looking so similar added a small amount of friction all
            over the place. Someone pointed out the wisdom of the Cards Against
            Humanity decks: the different types of cards were totally inverted,
            immediately comprehensible as different. I tried to differentiate my
            card types by inverting the color schemes.
          </p>
          <h3>Sat Jun 29 12:48:15 PM PDT 2024</h3>
          <p>
            I made the two different decks into starkly different color
            palletes, using black backgrounds for one and white or light gray
            for the other. I also fixed the bug I found with the backs being
            mismatched where if a row contained cards of different types,
            because the back and front pages were printed back-to-back, they
            would be misaligned. A bit of programming fixed that.
          </p>
          <p>
            <future-
              >I changed the name of communication cards to
              &quot;Directives&quot;. I looked at &quot;Dossiers&quot; from
              classic spy/war films/props for more thematic
              inspiration.</future-
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            I considered putting indicators on the card for &quot;right&quot;
            and &quot;wrong&quot;, but I couldn't think of how to do it. I took
            my previous prototype in my hands, fanned the cards, and stared at a
            mirror on my bathroom. I tried to play out the game with other
            people in my mind. I felt only a little insane. Eventually I saw
            that it was pretty confusing understanding the order of the cards
            fanned out in someone's hand. From the holder's perspective, they'd
            be lowest-to-highest, but from another person's perspective, staring
            at the back, they'd be in the reverse order. So before indicating
            &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot;, I wanted to help people
            understand &quot;greater than&quot; and &quot;less than&quot;, i.e.
            what order the person was holding the cards in. So for the next
            prototype, I put &quot;less than&quot; and &quot;greater than&quot;
            symbols (&quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot;) in the corners of the
            cards. On the reverse, they were the opposite direction, and also on
            the reflection on the bottom of the card they were in the opposite
            direction. So the system could account for someone holding the cards
            in their hand in whatever orientation, and they could
            &quot;fix&quot; the symbols simply by flipping the card over.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later I came back and considered how to indicate what was
            &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot;, if that was actually
            important. One theory I had for how to build tension and stakes was
            to make it more clear how many &quot;strikes&quot; (wrong guesses)
            the team had, and I thought the &quot;wrong&quot; indicator, bright
            and obnoxious would help establish the raising stakes and tension.
            And an equally garish &quot;right&quot; indicator might make success
            feel more awesome. I ultimately let this idea go because I dropped
            the concept of representing the state of the game in one person's
            hand. It was too fiddly. I did want to think about raising the
            stakes and visually representing the stakes but it didn't seem worth
            any bit of fiddliness in a light-hearted party game.

          <p>
            Considering names, I looked up &quot;Numberlines&quot; as
            recommended by Jed and Griffin. I didn't love the name but two
            separate people saying they liked it compelled me to check it out. I
            did find a game called
            <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/224215/numberline"
              >Numberline</a
            >
            (no &quot;s&quot;), but it didn't seem to be a huge release. I
            wasn't sure of the legal implications for using such a similar name.
            I also thought about &quot;Numsense&quot;, but that name is also
            <a href="https://www.numsense.org/">not original</a>. Another name I
            considered was &quot;Flaw In Order,&quot; but I felt like I would
            need to follow that name up with a detective theme, and I wasn't
            sure I could.
          </p>
          <h3>Fri Jul 5 03:56:03 PM PDT 2024</h3>
          <p>
            At a playtest this week I attempted a couple different rulesets. In
            the first round, we used the old ruleset; each player held their
            card face down in front of them, and the goal was for each person to
            flip over their card in order, from lowest to highest. The
            &quot;one&quot; problem was definitely present, since the person
            with the &quot;1&quot; card immediately flipped their card over. The
            next rule set was for all the players to swap cards with each other,
            still face down, until they were in order, without revealing a
            single one until the end. In that version, the Director (the player
            who picked the Directive card) had to have the lowest card, the
            person to their left had to have the next higher, all the way around
            the group until the person on the Director's right had the highest
            card. The final ruleset was similar, except the Director held onto
            their card (not swap), while all the other players swapped their
            cards to put them in order around the Director. The benefit of this
            cascading ruleset was that it introduced slight changes to make the
            game more complicated incrementally, slowly until the
            &quot;one&quot; problem was solved.
          </p>
          <p>
            For me, the first round was the only fun and light and quick one.
            The other two rounds, especially the last one, were a slog. Some
            people in the group found it an engaging puzzle, but it wasn't the
            type of puzzle I wanted to play. In my view, it involved keeping too
            much information in your head. Especially in the last round,
            everyone wanted to collaborate to figure out what all the other
            players had before they made any swaps.
          </p>
          <p>
            Players weren't sure if they should minimize swapping. There wasn't
            any rule against swapping a lot, but it would probably be a bad idea
            to swap a lot because you could &quot;lose&quot; a card, forgetting
            whose card you were holding. That would be really boring to try to
            figure out. Well, boring might be too inspecific a description.
            Because this might be an interesting challenge for a group that was
            really good at the rest of the challenge.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the next playtest, I wanted to try the same concept of
            increasing the difficulty round after round. But I didn't want to do
            the swapping with the hidden information. Maybe it would be easier
            to do the swapping without the hidden information part. That is,
            everyone can look at any card they swap with. And maybe they can
            only swap twice? That sounds like obnoxious book keeping. On top of
            that, the &quot;optimal number of swaps&quot; is not the fun puzzle
            i want to play. So for the next playtest, I thought we could try
            keeping the cards in each players' hands (instead of the Director
            collecting them and ordering them in their hand). But players could
            only flip their card when the Director directed them to by pointing
            at them and saying &quot;flip!&quot; I tried to think of another a
            more thematic command, but none came quick. And similar to in the
            previous playtest, in the more advanced round, the group would need
            to have the cards flipped in order starting with the Director's
            card, wrapping around.
          </p>

            Maybe it would be helpful for me to attempt to write out what I
            think is fun about this game, so that I can refocus on my goal. The
            fun part is people trying to figure out how to express the number 17
            given the directive &quot;Vehicles.&quot; It's nonsense (hense my
            desire to make the game called &quot;numsense&quot;). The ordering
            puzzle presents a devilishly straightforward framework which beckons
            the players with the question, &quot;come on, this is a simple game,
            you can do this can't you?&quot; That is basically a trojan horse
            which leaves the players' guards down for the highly uncomfortable
            actual task of saying song lyrics which include the number 6.
          </p>

            Also during this playtest I gave out &quot;strikes&quot; if people
            said any numbers at all. While conversing, many people couldn't seem
            to avoid saying &quot;one.&quot; This was effective for reminding
            people of the

            Also during that round I came up with a name I really love,
            &quot;Countability.&quot;

            I added some more Directives, &quot;Movie titles,&quot;,
            &quot;Flavors,&quot; &quot;Vacations,&quot; and
            &quot;superheroes.&quot; Then I realized I already had Movie Titles.
            Whoops. I almost added &quot;countries&quot; and &quot;US
            States,&quot; but I held back. Something about them irked me. That
            they might turn into a trivia competition, with people feeling bad
            about not knowing the relative sizes of different nations or
            territories. I was 50/50 on the decision, my logic did not feel
            sound to me, but I went with my gut.
          </p>
          <p>
            I took another stab at writing out the rules on cards of their own.
            This was the last major component I wanted to work hard on before
            trying to connect with a visual designer.

            I also removed the less than and greater than symbols from the
            cards, since I had moved on from the version of the game where
            players fanned the cards in their hands. And I also removed the pips
            from 2 of the corners, so that they only remained on 2 of the
            corners.
          </p>
          <p>
            And I removed the saboteur card. I'd never actually playtested it.
            The game was fun without it.

            Based on the feedback I got from a party, I put in some more effort
            into my game.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, I tried using the numbers 1 to 24 instead of 1 to 21. That
            was a friend's idea, because it was divisible by more things.

            The most difficult numbers were the teens. It's really hard to
            associate a vehicle with the number 17. So I wanted to do a playtest
            with a lower number, around 12. I was worried that there wasn't
            enough missing information or variety in the numbers to make the
            game challenging. On the other hand, I was excited to feel the
            faster paced, lighter, less puzzling version of the game.

            As I read The Art of Game Design: A book of Lenses by Jesse Schell,
            I thought a lot about this game. One topic in the book was &quot;The
            Lens of the Elemental Tetrad,&quot; which pursuaded me that story
            and aesthetics were as important as mechanics and technology, the
            latter being my main focus so far. As I thought about story and
            aesthetics, I realized that my game had little to nothing decided in
            that department. A future topic in the book was Theme, and as I
            considered my game, I realized it was a party game. And so a party
            was a fitting aesthetic. What were themes associated with parties?
            Celebrating someone. Everyone loves to feel special and in the
            spotlight. That one meshed with one of the core mechanics of the
            game, that one person be in the spotlight every round, the main
            decider. And who wouldn't love to make the decisions at their own
            party?
          </p>
          <p>
            So, what would a thematic party look like where counting or numbers
            or putting things in order were the main focus?
          </p>
          <p>
            I thought of the moment during a birthday party when everyone
            gathers around the birthday person to watch them open each gift one
            by one. There's a certain tension in the order there, everyone
            waiting for the moment their present gets opened. There's also the
            implicit ordering of &quot;the best gift&quot; as everyone watches
            every other gift opened and compares it to their measily
            contribution (or knows they went all out and no one has a chance of
            besting them). So maybe my game could be about that, and
            thematically everyone could be bringing a present. Maybe the order
            in which the gifts will be opened is predetermined (the order
            implied by the number cards given out) and the theme of the gifts is
            well-in-advance, so everyone can &quot;bring a gift that matches the
            theme and the order&quot;. This is a weird concept though, and it
            certainly doesn't fit easily into my preconceived notions about
            parties! If the theme is about honoring the one person, then it
            would make sense if the order thing was the birthday-person's wish.
            But it was kind of nonsense that this birthday person would feel
            really strongly about the order that gifts are opened but then
            randomly give out the order, and then hide that information? It felt
            like I was on to something, but it would be a lateral movement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe I should think about other reasons to have a party than just a
            birthday with gifts?
          </p>
          <p>
            What about a stone soup theme party. Or a potluck. I couldn't puzzle
            out where the order or amount came in. But the stone soup story was
            really compelling! Maybe it was because I hadn't yet eaten breakfast
            when I started thinking about this. An interesting element of the
            stone soup story is that it is a story. So what if the order part
            was not that all the participants were really making the soup, but
            instead everyone was trying to remember the story and the order it
            went in, and so the shared party activity was actually trying to
            remember the order the story went in.

              party, this would be the birthday person/child/boy/girl. At a gala
              or something this would be the &quot;honoree.&quot; What about a
              retirement party? Retiree? Is there a more general term for this?
              Or maybe if I got more specific with the story than the generic
              &quot;party&quot;, then the name would be apparent.</future-

            Played at a wedding, tried the theme of a birthday party out and it
            didn't make any sense when I explained it. Oh well.
          </p>
          <p>
            What about this for a theme: We're learning to communicate with
            Aliens who don't understand the concepts of order or number. And the
            aliens get offended if we mention things they don't understand. So
            we take turns acting out as the Alien? Or the lead scientist who is
            going to be the one who talks to the alien? We've tried everything
            to explain counting and order to them but they just don't get it, so
            now we're just literally throwing spaghetti at the wall and seeing
            what sticks.

            else to draw from it, but it does seem similar.

            In hte last month, someone sent me a picture of a game called
            &quot;ito&quot; I found it on
            <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/327778/ito"

              >The Dice Tower's review of Ito</a
            >. It seemed kinda similar? It had number cards from 1 to 100.
            Category cards like &quot;things you could stare at all day.&quot;
            It made me giggle that ito also had action cards which might make
            people uncomfortable. ito seemed to have a lot of the same energy as
            I was going for, and it seemed really successful. It made me feel
            great that I made something even somewhat similar to such a
            successful game.
