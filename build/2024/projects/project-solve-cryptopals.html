<h2>Logbook</h2>
<h3>Mon Jan 08 23:47:35 PST 2024</h3>
<p><a href="topic-recurse-center.md">Started during RC, to follow along with the weekly group</a>. The first homework assignment was to attempt <a href="https://cryptopals.com/sets/1">Set 1, Challenges 1-3</a>. I wanted to attempt them inline on this page.</p>
<h3>Tue Jan 9 03:03:15 PM PST 2024</h3>
<p>I took a moment to extract and solidify my live-code component from other projects, so that I can present all the code easily on this page while I work on it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set 1 Challenge 1: Convert hex to base64</p>
<p>The string <a href="long%20string%20of%20hex" title="Auto-generated wikilink">long string of hex</a> should produce <a href="shorter%20string%20of%20base64" title="Auto-generated wikilink">shorter string of base64</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>with the important note included:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Always operate on raw bytes, never on encoded strings. Only use hex and base64 for pretty-printing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the first order of business would be to take the string of hex and convert it to raw bytes.</p>
<p>I had never extensively manipulated raw bytes in JavaScript beyond some experiments with bitwise operators. So I searched &quot;using raw bytes in javascript&quot; and started to read up. I found <a href="https://dev.to/lucasdamianjohnson/using-binary-data-in-javascript-3fn2">this article</a> to have some good introductory overview.</p>
<p>The API for <code>Uint8Array</code> made the most sense to me to manipulate raw bytes, so I tried that. I used <code>parseInt(n, 16)</code> to read in each couplet of hex digits, and write the resultant number to the next index in the typed array. Then I transformed it back into hex to verify if my head was on my shoulders. That worked! Next I tried changing <code>toString(16)</code> to <code>toString(64)</code>, because surely base64 is just as easy right? Nope! I got a fun, informative error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Uncaught RangeError: toString() radix argument must be between 2 and 36</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I found the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/btoa"><code>btoa</code> and <code>atob</code> methods in JavaScript</a> and saw that they act on ASCII strings. That made me think, maybe there is a plaintext message inside of these strings? So I tried decoding it. It was a message. I'll leave it to you to decode it though, heh.</p>
<p>So once I had the cleartext ASCII string, I was confident that the answer to the puzzle would be the &quot;binary string to base64-encoded ASCII string&quot; or <code>btoa</code> of that. I tried it and it worked!</p>
<p>Here's the code I came up with, and the results:</p>
<details>
<summary>Set 1 Challenge 1</summary>

{
  const hex = "49276d206b696c6c696e6720796f757220627261696e206c696b65206120706f69736f6e6f7573206d757368726f6f6d"
  const expectedBase64 = "SSdtIGtpbGxpbmcgeW91ciBicmFpbiBsaWtlIGEgcG9pc29ub3VzIG11c2hyb29t";
<p>// One hex character is 4 bits, so for every two hex characters, we need a byte
window.decodeHexStringToUint8Array = (hex) =&gt; {
const bytes = new Uint8Array(hex.length / 2);
for (let i = 0; i &lt; hex.length; i+=2) {
const hexByte = hex.substring(i, i + 2);
const numByte = parseInt(hexByte, 16);
bytes<a href="i%20/%202" title="Auto-generated wikilink">i / 2</a> = numByte;
}
return bytes;
}</p>
<p>const bytes = decodeHexStringToUint8Array(hex);</p>
<p>const hexResult = Array.from(bytes).map(b =&gt; b.toString(16)).join(&quot;&quot;);
const stringResult = Array.from(bytes).map(b =&gt; String.fromCharCode(b)).join(&quot;&quot;);
// Doesn't work!
// const base64Result = Array.from(bytes).map(b =&gt; b.toString(64)).join(&quot;&quot;);
const base64Result = btoa(stringResult)
const isCorrect = base64Result === expectedBase64;</p>
<p>// Silly trick to write to an HTML element

// But then document.currentScript is null, so we need a closure
setTimeout(

)</p>
<p>}
</p>

<p>After all of that, I figured there must be a shorter way. But I couldn't think of it, so I proceeded to Challenge 2.</p>

<p>Write a function that takes two equal-length buffers and produces their XOR combination.</p>

<p>I took a moment to globalize my prior function to decode a hex array. Then I dove in. This one went quickly. And I got another nice string message hah.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I wasn't sure if this meant a single character repeated (number of bytes) times, or a buffer of all zeros except for one byte of a character.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Find the key, decrypt the message. You can do this by hand. But don't: write code to do it for you. How? Devise some method for &quot;scoring&quot; a piece of English plaintext. Character frequency is a good metric. Evaluate each output and choose the one with the best score.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This scared me. How much code did I need to write to calculate the character frequency of the resultant text? I dove in regardless. First I tried a single character repeated in every byte of the string. Pretty quickly I had frequencies printing out in my console, but I wasn't sure how to interpret them. So I searched &quot;character frequencies for english&quot; and found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency">a wikipedia page</a>, much to my surprise. So I tried just checking if the frequency of the character 'e' and 'a' were within 10% of the norm described on that page. And I got two hits!</p>
<p>They were for the characters <code>V</code> and <code>v</code>. Strangely, the frequency distributions for those two seemed identical. That confounded me. Then I thought it must have something to do with the fact that they are 32 ASCII table entries apart, as are every uppercase-lowercase pair. No, I didn't get it at all, I was grasping at straws. And furthermore, the decoded text for both was nonsense: <code>mAAEG@Icm	]BGEKO^A[@JAHLOMA@</code></p>
<p>So I tried widening the acceptable ranges of the frequencies to see if there were any other solutions nearby. I found more solutions then, but the resultant strings were still nonsense to me. I reread the prompt and found it was more detailed in its hint than I originally understood. It said &quot;choose the one with the best score,&quot; which implied I should find a total score for the differences of all characters between their expected frequency and actual, and then find the entry which has the lowest difference from the expectation. So I hand-translated the table from the wiki page into a JavaScript object I could compare against.</p>
<p>It a bunch of code to calculate the differences, but it was simple all-and-all. It didn't work at first. I was still getting nonsense results. Then I realized that the answer probably wouldn't have a bunch of non-alphabetical characters in it. So I added a bit more fake difference for each non-alphabetical answer. And it worked! The cleartext shot to the top of my sorting function immediately! W00T!</p>
<p>I tried lowering the punishment I gave, and found I could go surprisingly low. It made sense in hindsight - bad answers would have a lot of gunk in there.</p>

<h3>Sun Jan 14 11:59:30 AM PST 2024</h3>
<p>After the first RC meetup on the topic where I saw others' low-level language solutions, I decided to restart the challenges in C. Unfortunately, that meant I would lose my ability to run these in-browser. But that's just one more way I had to commit to escape my comfort zone! On the positive side, I had already set up my workspace for C for <a href="/2024/projects/project-explore-uxn-and-playdate.html">Playdate development</a>.</p>
<p>I created a new project directory and <a href="https://github.com/reedspool/cryptopals-clang">git &amp; GitHub repository</a>. Then I created and ran a Hello World C program. I installed <code>clang-format</code> which Doom Emacs picked up immediately.</p>
<p>I also began reading <a href="http://docs.hfbk.net/beej.us/bgc/">Beej's Guide to C Programming</a> as I began this, since I hadn't written significant C in a long time. I had to shake off a lot of mental cobwebs as I began, and also search for a lot of basic stuff, like <code>strlen</code>.</p>
<p>I got through decoding hex to binary with few speed bumps. Encoding to base64 really stretched my brain. My strategy was to &quot;unroll the loop in my head&quot;. That is, I immediately jumped to writing a for-loop, knowing that I'd have to loop through the whole input to produce the output. But I had no idea what to put there. So I write out C code to produce the first few characters with no loop, just a lot of numbers and indices. Once that worked, I tried to extract a pattern and refine it into a simpler loop. It took me a long time to puzzle it out, but when everything clicked into place, I wasn't displeased with my solution!</p>
<p>I moved on to challenge 2. Again I had to hex decode the input. So I took a moment to refresh my memory on how to make, import, and use an external function in C so that I could start to build a library of reusable parts like hex decoding. That went smoothly enough. I had to make a new utility function to re-encode hex, and reversing the function I'd already written was a bigger stumbling block than the hex decoding itself.</p>
<p>For challenge 3, I had to determine how to represent the expected frequency table form my JavaScript code. I ended up with an array of double-length floating point frequencies where the value for the letter &quot;a&quot; was the first entry. Over the years, I've forgotten just how much I take for granted with a dynamic language!</p>
<p><future->I checked out other people's C solutions (Jacob V's!)</future-></p>
<h3>Tue Jan 16 10:21:26 AM PST 2024</h3>
<p>As I began working on challenge 4, my plan was:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read the file in</li>
<li>Split it into an array of <code>char *</code></li>
<li>Extract my analysis from challenge 3 into a utility which returns an array of structs <code>{ char byte, char *line, double score }</code></li>
<li>Run that analysis for each line of the input and compile the results into one big list</li>
<li>Sort that list to raise the optimal scores to the top</li>
</ol>
<p>My first step was simple - I downloaded the input file. Then, I didn't know how to read a file in from C. These two SO answers got me on my feet, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/3501681">1</a> and then because I didn't understand that the <code>#define</code> line was important, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/59014150">2</a>.</p>
<p>Then I took a moment to both extract analysis from challenge 3 as a utility function, and at the same time create the struct as a more usable return value. That took a lot of fiddling. Especially <code>malloc</code>ing structs and a list of structs was confusing. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14768230/malloc-for-struct-and-pointer-in-c">This SO answer</a> helped me understand.</p>
<p>Hours later, I had a working answer to challenge 4. I had to fix many non-obvious errors with memory allocation. I couldn't say I concretely learned a lesson except that I was reminded thoroughly of the tedium of memory. This was the reason I was doing C, though, so it was good to have a practical reason to push through this retraining. After I thought I had every memory bug alleviated, my answer was still off. My calculation looked correct, but the answer was nonsense. I'm not sure how, but the thought occurred to me that I might be giving a bad score for spaces, which are a totally normal thing in English. I added a clause to not punish spaces specifically, and suddenly the answer jumped out at me! Still as exciting and relieving as the first time! Success reinvigorated me to keep pushing.</p>
<p>Challenge 5 looked comparably straightforward. I wasn't sure whether I should not encrypt the newline in the input statement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Burning 'em, if you ain't quick and nimble[newline]
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because the same newline existed in the expected output.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>0b3637272a2b2e63622c2e69692a23693a2a3c6324202d623d63343c2a26226324272765272
a282b2f20430a652e2c652a3124333a653e2b2027630c692b20283165286326302e27282f</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tried with the newline in the input, but without the newline in the output. I figured that the newline would exist encoded in the binary, because this algorithm should be able to encode arbitrary binary, not just the rap lyric. That was correct! In just a few minutes, my solution succeeded on the first try!</p>
<p>Challenge 6 seemed like an entirely different beast. I decided to do the first fun part and write the Hamming Distance function. I was proud of my observation that I could use XOR between the two inputs to get 1's for every differing bit. Then I just had to count the 1 bits. I thought there must be a more clever solution to count the number of 1's in a byte than the for loop I wrote which just shifted each bit down and masked it with 1. But it worked, and it compiled without error the first try!</p>
<h3>Sat Jan 27 01:52:53 PM PST 2024</h3>
<p>Since I solved challenge 5, I fell off. I hoped to get back to Cryptopals soon or someday because it was immensely fun. I reflected on what kept me from proceeding in a conversation with Jacob and found it was too much of a challenge to use C when I felt so basic with it. I was learning C via other projects and having a lot of fun. But with Cryptopals, my lack of knowledge was an issue when I ran into a bug. Because I was also a beginner in the space of cryptography, I never knew if the issue was a bug in my program or with my cryptographic logic. So I thought I might go back to JavaScript or continue with C when I had more experience.</p>
<p>[@JAHLOMA@`</p>
<p>So I tried widening the acceptable ranges of the frequencies to see if there were any other solutions nearby. I found more solutions then, but the resultant strings were still nonsense to me. I reread the prompt and found it was more detailed in its hint than I originally understood. It said &quot;choose the one with the best score,&quot; which implied I should find a total score for the differences of all characters between their expected frequency and actual, and then find the entry which has the lowest difference from the expectation.
