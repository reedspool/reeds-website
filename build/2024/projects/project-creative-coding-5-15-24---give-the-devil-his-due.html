        <h1>Project: Creative Coding 5/15/24 - Give The Devil His Due</h1>
        <h2>Logbook</h2>
        <h3>Wed May 15 10:27:58 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time) 2024</h3>
        <p>The Creative Coding prompt was:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>He will give the devil his due. — from King Henry IV</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Someone
          <a
            href="https://www.myenglishpages.com/idiom/give-the-devil-his-due-meaning-and-examples/"
            >looked up the meaning of that phrase</a
          >.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            one has to acknowledge the positive qualities of a person who is
            unpleasant or disliked.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          I was grateful because I would have come up with a completely
          different idea of the meaning, something about an evil library.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had recently watched
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAbBID3N64A"
            >AI-driven Dynamic Dialog through Fuzzy Pattern Matching</a
          >. That describes how Valve makes actors talk to each other based on
          the current situation of the world. I wanted to make a simulation
          where a handful of autonomous actors trade procedurally generated
          dialogue. The actors could act out any situation, so I thought I could
          sufficiently abide by the creative prompt.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started out with some hand-crafted actors with weird names. The
          thought developed into a scene where people are trading bad jokes to
          pass the time.

          I got to a place where each character would tell some jokes, and
          eventually they'd all be too exhausted. I wanted them to regain
          stamina and start telling jokes again. When I tried to add regaining
          stamina, I realized I wasn't sure where it would go. My best thought
          was to make a separate temporal system, a normal real-time game loop
          where each character would regain some small chunk of their stamina
          over time. That didn't fit into the current model at all, where I was
          focused on an event-based model. But it made sense that to see a
          real-time scene play out, we'd want both a real-time engine, and an
          event engine. The real-time engine might spit out events regularly,
          and the event engine would respond, sometimes spitting out more events
          in its response, or scheduling new event listeners for future
          real-time triggers. Seemed like a great pairing, and closer to what I
          had in my other project. So instead of attempting to build this
          event-based dialogue generator in isolation, I realized it would be
          another component of the system I'd built elsewhere.
