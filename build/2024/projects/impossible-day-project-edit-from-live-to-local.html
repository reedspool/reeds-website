        <h1>Impossible Day Project: Edit from Live to Local</h1>
        <h2>Logbook</h2>
        <h3>Thu Jan 18 08:46:33 PST 2024</h3>
        <p>
          About 5 minutes before I spoke up at the Impossible Day Kickoff at RC,
          I realized I'd been kicking around this idea in my head for a while. I
          had discounted it and forgotten about it because I couldn't imagine
          how to do it. Well, that's what this day was all about.
        </p>
        <p>
          To start, I
          <a
            href="https://excalidraw.com/#json=VDHFUMC8MjqRMdHX_aU0I,x8M-hNYAPUmEQO6kB8a7KA"
            >drew a diagram of the concept</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>With that, I felt like I could put the idea into some words.</p>
        <p>
          The goal: Enable live editing on my website (<a
            href="https://reeds.website"
            >https://reeds.website</a
          >, not just localhost). I can edit in the browser and those edits show
          up on my local disk.
        </p>
        <p>There are two confounding factors:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            How does my live website send messages to my local computer to edit
            my file system securely?
          </li>
          <li>
            How do edits to my page map back to their source code? There is a
            convoluted process by which source becomes the output HTML. The
            source is often MDX or JSX, which is often shaped differently from
            the resultant HTML.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Question #1 seemed less impossible to me, but an exciting project for
          another time. Jeff provided some thoughts for a server which poked
          some holes in my simple idea. The problem still felt possible, but
          more complex.
        </p>
        <p>
          Question #2 felt absolutely impossible. I had used source code maps
          generated by tools like Babel. That felt complicated enough. If I had
          a source map, it might feel possible to connect that to the output and
          map edits in the other direction, from output to source. But I
          couldn't imagine any such tools would work for my website.
        </p>
        <p>
          I recently had rebuilt my website generator from a bunch of disparate
          parts which I barely felt like I understood.
        </p>
        <p>
          P.B. shared that MDX has
          <a href="https://mdxjs.com/packages/mdx/#fields"
            >a source code generating option</a
          >. Apparently that
          <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/source-map"
            >relied on a mozilla library</a
          >. We tried it out together on a call to see what it generated. We got
          what looked like a map!
