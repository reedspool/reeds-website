        <h2>Characters</h2>
        <h3>Shipboard Computer</h3>
        <p>Codename: SB</p>
        <p>
          A computer intelligence infused in the ship. Its first conscious
          moments were on the ship and they feel the ship is their corporeal
          body.
        </p>
        <h3>Me</h3>
        <p>Code name: ME</p>
        <p>The ship's captain. The player character.</p>
        <h3>The Rest Of The Crew</h3>
        <p>
          6 Souls under the care of The Captain onboard The Ship. They each have
          names, histories, and desires. They are all from diasporatic parts of
          Earth.
        </p>
        <h2>Non-characters</h2>
        <h3>The Ship</h3>
        <p>A Big Class Freighter</p>
        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>
          The captain (ME) wakes up disoriented. The shipboard computer (SB),
          the captain's trusted companion, explains that the ship is about to
          explode. It does. The captain wakes up again disoriented. This time,
          he has an inkling of what he's supposed to do. Hit a button. He hits
          the button just in time to save the ship. Unfortunately, another
          disaster is around the corner and the ship explodes again with him
          inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          SB confirms that this is a simulation. SB started the simulation
          because of a terrible disaster in reality. ME requests more detail on
          that, SB declines to fill ME in.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, ME doesn't know this, but in reality the ship is in dire
          straights. SB has lost most function, ME is in the medical bay
          receiving brain surgery. This whole situation is training for ME to
          wake up ready to save the ship as soon as the surgery is complete.
        </p>
        <p>
          ME was the captain. ME relied on the rest of the crew for the detailed
          running of the ship, but they're all dead or more incapacitated than
          ME at the moment. So SB's last-ditch effort was to train ME on the
          functions of the entire ship and get ME back on their feet before the
          ship really exploded. And there are a lot of things going wrong right
          now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each module that SB introduces to ME to learn about is another system
          which SB is discovering is problematic in real time. So SB is learning
          about these things from the ship's manual, discovering the state of
          them with their drones, and trying to teach ME in a simulation they're
          creating in real time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why can't SB just fix the things themselves with the drones? It's not
          allowed because it's just a tactical and strategic advisor as per its
          programming. (That feels weak.)
        </p>
        <p>
          So as ME learns more about the ship, they also learn more about the
          situation outside. How did this panel get like that? SB lets slip more
          about the situation with each new panel and widget they must teach ME.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the situation is bad. ME's crew was all in hibernation. ME was
          awake on rotation. But ME didn't understand any of the ship's
          functions and controls, so when an asteroid field alarm popped up,
          they didn't know what to do. They didn't want to wake anyone else up
          so they tried to figure out what to do by themselves, but they were
          too late and things started going very bad very fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          SB and ME's relationship was always tricky. SB always wanted to help
          everyone on their ship, but because ME was incompetent but trying to
          look like they knew what they were doing, SB's helpful running
          commentary made ME feel like SB was needling ME for not understanding
          even the most basic things. SB took this as a sign to replicate ME's
          behavior and became even more unlikable as a result the more they
          mirrored them.
        </p>
        <p>
          ME gets better at handling everything as the disasterous situation
          mounts in danger. The rest of the crew is in hibernation, induced
          comas in the medical bay. ME is getting priority treatment as the
          commanding officer, even as some of the other crew might be better
          suited to solving the problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually things get so bad that it looks like there is no way to
          save everyone. ME must make a choice to save themselves or the rest of
          the crew. SB will be fine either way.
        </p>
        <p>
          SB can't understand the dilemma. Either the captain chooses to make
          the numerically correct choice and save 6 crew members instead of
          their single self, or they make the selfish choice for survival. If ME
          would just decide on one of those metrics for success, SB would
          understand, but the dilemma is what confuses SB.
        </p>
        <h2>Logbook</h2>
        <h3>Sat Oct 14 10:56:12 AM PDT 2023</h3>
        <p>
          I had an idea for a game where you mostly interact through a chat log,
          though buttons and more complex widgets appear in that chat log.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to incrementally design the game so I created a prototype as
          quickly as possible. I started with a chat log which displayed a
          scripted dialog between two characters.
        </p>
        <h3>Mon Oct 16 08:09:37 PM PDT 2023</h3>
        <p>I brainstormed an opening script:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            SB (Shipboard computer): You're about to die ME: What?! SB: There's
            a 100% chance you're going to die imminently ME: Why?! SB: Riveting
            conversationalist... SB: Because you didn't know you had to Rev The
            Convulator until now ME: What's the...
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Then a button saying &quot;Rev the Convulator&quot; appears.</p>
        <p>
          I thought to prioritize a short and snappy opening. I would have a
          short attention span before I was invested in the story, the
          characters, and the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted each log line to have different colors for the character's
          names, at least, to easily differentiate who was talking without
          really reading intently.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thought the player character should die for the first time quickly
          after the beginning of the game to show that death is perfectly fine,
          unavoidable, and part of the game play.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the Rev the Convulator button must not succeed. Unless a player was
          cheating somehow. I wanted to deal with cheating in a special way,
          because I wanted to encourage it but still refer to it as cheating, or
          at least speak of it as meta to the game. I knew getting meta about a
          game that was only in my head was lofty but I thought I'd write down
          the thought to not impede myself by my own judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was thinking the Convulator Meter should be counting down in real
          time. If it wasn't real-time, then I couldn't think of a way that it
          shouldn't succeed.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the rev button pushes the meter up a bit from zero, or the absolute
          danger zone. But then you couldn't just click it again. So it must be
          disabled after one rev. Maybe on a cooldown? But the cooldown is a bit
          too much for the first time. So there's a better button, Rev Harder or
          something the second time. I was unsure, so I left such thoughts alone
          until I had a prototype to try them out on.
        </p>
        <h3>Mon Oct 23 09:40:35 PM PDT 2023</h3>
        <p>
          I put a spoiler alert and started writing about the characters and
          story I envisioned. When I didn't have the energy to code, I could
          find some energy to write.
        </p>
        <h3>Thu Oct 26 05:55:38 PM PDT 2023</h3>
        <p>I wrote more of the story thoughts I'd been thinking.</p>
        <p>
          I also wrote the quickest code I could think of to get each line of
          dialogue written to the screen over a span of time. It was broken
          JavaScript, but I could come back later to fix it.
        </p>
        <h3>Thu Nov 16 05:12:32 PM PST 2023</h3>
        <p>
          I fixed my JavaScript and expanded on it a little bit. I saw my chat
          log for the first time. The sight of my own words scrawled out as if
          spoken by someone else compelled me to move forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          I explored how to write client-side Javascript and JSX with NakedJSX
          which I wrote about in
          <a href="/2025/projects/project-improve-this-website.html"
            >my project to improve this website</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thought about how the game in my imagination had several different
          interwoven systems. A system for providing dialog, a system for
          controlling time, tracking real time. Another system for the actual
          mechanics of the spaceship and their status at any given point in
          time. I didn't quite know how to write maintainable code with all
          those systems interacting.
        </p>
        <h3>Sat Nov 18 06:26:07 PM PST 2023</h3>
        <p>
          Now that I had some chat scrolling through, I made my first game
          mechanic/widget, &quot;the Convulator&quot;. I gave it that name for
          being convoluted. I wanted all my widgets to suggest bonkers sci-fi
          foolery with names that sounded almost sci-fi-ish until you realized
          they were nonsense. I imagined the Convulator would be a simple timer
          counting down to demise and a button to &quot;rev&quot; it, which
          would increase the remaining time a bit. I imagined the player
          frustrated that they needed to keep clicking this button lest their
          ship explode. I didn't know if that was a fun idea, but I was still
          prototyping.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started with a status indicator counting down. I used a
          <code>progress</code> HTML element, which I'd never used before but it
          seemed to fit the bill. That went quick so I moved on to a button
          which &quot;revved&quot; that countdown a bit. Again, quick.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a working, dynamic widget, my mind went back to the question of
          systems. The next thing I wanted was for the text of the story to
          react to the status of the widget. In reacting to the widget, the text
          would really be reacting to the player's choices and actions. Did they
          hit the button before it ran out? Did they let the timer expire? If
          the convulator's value went to zero, the ship exploded and the player
          character was deceased. After that, the simulation would need to
          restart.
        </p>
        <p>
          As it stood, the text kept going regardless of the state of the
          widget. So I'd need the widget to inform the text to keep going. This
          meant two separate systems interacting. The widget system, and the
          text system. My first thought was to use an event emitter and event
          listener, pub sub pattern, to communicate between the two systems to
          keep them decoupled. This aligned well with the browser environment
          where there was already such a pattern implemented. I was concerned
          that in the long run this could be slow, but it would be a premature
          optimization to consider that now.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wrote a global event listener for the text system and an event
          emitter on te widget. This also meant rewriting the dialogue system to
          stop and start and use different text at different times, instead of
          just one single stream of text. That worked well and went quickly with
          only one bug that rapidly filled my webpage with blank lines until it
          nearly crashed.
        </p>
        <p>
          And with that, I had a game! I could lose the game by letting the
          Convulator fall to empty, and I could survive as long as I wanted if I
          kept Reving it. It was not fun, but it was intriguing. I could feel
          myself hoping there was more which was a compelling feeling. If I
          could follow through on that feeling, maybe it would actually be
          engaging!
        </p>
        <p>
          I considered my next moves. The introductory dialogue I had so far
          explicitly said that the player should not be capable of saving the
          ship. How would that be? If I wanted to depend on surprising the
          player, I could just make the Convulator too depleted and too quickly
          depleting for human reaction speeds to account for. But I wanted the
          game to be a bit slower-paced than that (at least at these beginning
          stages). I ended up revealing only the meter, and not the Rev button,
          so that the player would have literally no recourse and then die and
          get annoyed. Hopefully their annoyance would transfer onto the
          Shipboard character. I thought it would help if the Shipboard computer
          character repeatedely made it clear that they were in control.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next I added a button to restart the simulation. I thought the
          repeated text would be boring so I considered a few solutions. I could
          add some way to fast forward to the action. I could also change the
          text on the second restart, but that didn't feel good because it might
          be confusing to someone who expected a verbatim repetition with no
          memory. Although that confusion could be a nice surprise, oh there's
          more story next time! That confuses the premise though, because why is
          Shipboard computer changing what they're saying if they're actually
          repeating this this simulation themselves and trying to scientifically
          train the captain, wouldn't they repeat their same script to isolate
          that as a variable? Maybe they just got bored of that. One thing
          humans will never be able to empathize with AI about is that they are
          always fully there, whereas we're blessed in a way by our limited
          capability to only be in one place at a time.

            >After the first widget, I wanted a couple more widgets to be
            revealed as necessary. I could imagine a player getting bored of the
            game transitioning from novel to boring and formulaic. AI wonder if
            I could time that moment to twist the game up. I thought of the
            graph of flow state between boredom and challenge? Ralph Koster's
            book about Fun? So what way could I twist up the game? Well the
            player is getting bored of the formula, so maybe the character can
            also be bored of the formula, and then the antagonist can do
            something to recognize that boredom and try to switch it up for
            them. An example would be if the shipboard computer simply decided
            to show you all the widgets and begin to explain one after the
            other, instead of letting you die a thousand times. And then of
            course you die because you don't know anything. Or maybe no you
            don't die because it would appear to take you a thousand years to
            sit and listen to all of these without polaying the game, so of
            course you decide not to. the player says &quot;enough&quot; at some
            point (although to enhance the joke I could write descriptions for
            an absurd number so the player can keep going as long as they'd
            like. Or maybe to start the player doesn't have a choice, and the
            shipboard computer decides forthem that this is useless. Maybe they
            point you to a wiki where you can read everything yourself instead
            of coding it all and keeping it up in code. Ya, go read the wiki if
            you want that.</future-

          I realized what I was making was very similar to an idle clicker game,
          but kind of the opposite. Usually in idle clicker games, you are
          taking time to make the numbers go up infinitely (but sometimes very
          slowly) but in my game, the numbers were going down all the time, and
          you were restarting. But the mechanics of progress bars and buttons to
          refill them or make them change speeds or fuel each other were
          similar.

        <p>
          As I played with the dialogue, I found that I wanted to write dialogue
          and also plug dialogue triggers into the codebase rapidly. I wanted to
          play with text timing and tone a lot. By play I mean switch around,
          swap out, split up, smoosh together, strip down the text.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is an example of an observation I made at work recently: Distinct
          domains update at different times for different reasons. In this case
          I see the distinct domains of &quot;gameplay code&quot; and
          &quot;dialogue&quot;, i.e. a screenplay. Of course there is gray area
          here, because the gameplay code sets off the dialogue system.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I'd been rolling around a thought about a solution in my head as
          well: Keep those distinct domains decoupled and distinct. The idea of
          keeping a distinct thing distinct reminds me of Making Wrong Things
          Look Wrong by Spolsky. To keep gameplay code and dialogue decoupled, I
          wanted to continue to rely on DOM events and listeners.
        </p>
        <p>
          I built the next mechanic of the game, the next widget, the
          &quot;Machinator&quot;, which supplied fuel to the Convulator.

            >I reviewed my client code and found some distinct domains which
            were highly coupled. I wanted to take a moment to try a different
            factoring of the code to see if I could decouple those distinct
            domains. I knew my game code would have a lot of cross-cutting
            concerns. There was a lot of life-cycle management of DOM
            elements-as-actors. There was some confusion about what those DOM
            elements-as-actors should be handling, because a lot of gameplay
            code was in those actors' onMount code. Everything, in fact, except
            for the dialogue system. The dialogue system was global and
            singular. Thuogh i realized I could have made the &quot;game&quot;
            container an element and stuffed that &quot;global and
            singular&quot; code into its onMount code. So that was two domains:
            gameplay logic and DOM elements (as actors cough). Another domain
            was &quot;realtime&quot;, my game code's relationship to wall clock
            time. I had several recursive setTimeout engines running. I had
            explored this a bit in my
            <a href="/2023/projects/project-precision-timer.html"
              >precision timer project</a
            >. Another domain was &quot;message passing&quot; between the
            actors, which seemed almost entirely covered by the DOM event
            listener system. Yet another domain was &quot;global state&quot;. A
            lot of state was stored in the actor's private variables, (and
            everything could be, as described above), but there was some state
            which aligned with global, singular state, e.g. progression points
            where the player achieved something significant and the story
            changes from then forward. Some state aligned more with being
            private on a DOM element actor, such as an input's current value. A
            proper consistent global state method would help with that. Of
            course another domain was the dialogue itself, which included
            widgets at the moment.</future-

          At this point, I kept pushing forward and made the next section I
          imagined, where Shipboard reveals all the widgets to you. I envisioned
          it as the final level, shown to the player early to annoy and bore
          them. The idea that I would want to bore my kind players reminded me
          of something I had heard about improv from a comedy podcast recently,
          "don't choose to be boring, because you might just succeed."

          I played with some elements of player interaction with and
          interpretation of the log. For example, I added lots of
          behind-the-scenes debugging information to game log and added a way to
          filter it out. Maybe the player could use the same filtering for
          important messages? If widgets only ever appeared in the scrolling
          chat log, then the widgets would roll off the top as new chat rolled
          in and force the player to scroll back to interact. And then if a new
          widget came in, then they'd be scrolling back and forth to interact
          with both. A solution to that would be a filter for "only widgets".
          <p>
            Thematically, I wanted to explore the question, &quot;what if in the
            future, chat logs like this were incredibly interactive and useful
            instead of the inert block of text we have today.&quot;

            Changing the code in this ephemeral way annoyed me because they
            mucked up my git diff. It took some energy to commit progress while
